            Who the Fuck is Denver?
        </h2>
            <p>
                The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.

                <li>Two tablespoons of diced onion</li>
                <li>Two tablespoons of diced green bell peppers</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>One third of shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

        <h2>
            Steps
        </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
                <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
